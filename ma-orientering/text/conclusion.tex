Although number theory is a so called pure field of mathematics\textemdash meaning it is primarily researched for the sake of mathematics itself, it's applications are plentiful. Many applications lie in the field of computer science and cryptography. The RSA cryptosystem is today widely used in the modern world for secure connection and will likely continue to be used for years to come.
