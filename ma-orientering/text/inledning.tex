Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts 
independently of any application outside mathematics. This does not necessarily imply abundance of the field. In fact applications of great importance have appeared throughout history. Take the mathematical branch of number theory as an example, even though the field has been studied for thousands of years without primary intent of being applied to the real world, modern society is heavily dependent on applications such as cryptography, which is used for secure communications \cite{crypto}.\\\\
